# DATASCI3000-Project-Group-1
Machine learning classification system identifying different types of gear fault from vibration signals. Using multiple different learning models, we aim to develop an effective model that can detect the earliest signs of mechanical degradation. Goal is to improve reliability, reduce unplanned stoppages, and support predictive maintenance practices
